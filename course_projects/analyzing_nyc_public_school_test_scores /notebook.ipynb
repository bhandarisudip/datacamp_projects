There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance:\n\n## Which schools produce the highest math scores?\n* Specifically, which schools have an average math SAT score of at least 80%?\n* Save the results as a pandas DataFrame called `best_math_schools`.\n\n## Who are the top 10 schools based on average results across reading, math, and writing?\n* Save the results as a pandas DataFrame called `top_10_schools`.\n\n## Which NYC borough has the largest standard deviation for SAT results?\n* Save the results as a pandas DataFrame called `largest_std_dev`.\n\n## Completing the project\n\n* Create a dictionary called `schools_analysis` containing the following key-value pairs:\n\t- `\"best_math_schools\"`: `best_math_schools` DataFrame.\n\t- `\"top_10_schools\"`: `top_10_schools` DataFrame.\n    - `\"largest_SAT_std_dev\"`: `largest_std_dev` DataFrame.","metadata":{},"id":"31abcb2c","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Find the best schools for math\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate average_SAT per school\nschools[\"average_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n# Top 10 performing schools\ntop_10_schools = schools.sort_values(\"average_SAT\", ascending=False)[[\"school_name\", \"average_SAT\"]].head(10)\n\n# Which borough has the highest standard deviation for average_SAT?\nboroughs = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"average_SAT\"].agg([\"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]).round(0).sort_values(\"mean\", ascending=False)\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs[\"std\"] == boroughs[\"std\"].max()]\n\n# Share your results in this format\nschools_analysis = {\"best_math_schools\": best_math_schools,\n                    \"top_10_schools\": top_10_schools,\n                    \"largest_SAT_std_dev\": largest_std_dev}\n\n# Call the answer!\nprint(schools_analysis)","metadata":{"executionTime":66,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Find the best schools for math\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 640][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate average_SAT per school\nschools[\"average_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\n# Top 10 performing schools\ntop_10_schools = schools.sort_values(\"average_SAT\", ascending=False)[[\"school_name\", \"average_SAT\"]].head(10)\n\n# Which borough has the highest standard deviation for average_SAT?\nboroughs = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"average_SAT\"].agg([\"count\", \"mean\", \"std\"]).round(0).sort_values(\"mean\", ascending=False)\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs[\"std\"] == boroughs[\"std\"].max()]\n\n# Share your results in this format\nschools_analysis = {\"best_math_schools\": best_math_schools,\n                    \"top_10_schools\": top_10_schools,\n                    \"largest_SAT_std_dev\": largest_std_dev}\n\n# Call the answer!\nprint(schools_analysis)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"c25fecd4-c465-47aa-89bb-ef22dafd03d2","execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'best_math_schools':                                            school_name  average_math\n88                              Stuyvesant High School           754\n170                       Bronx High School of Science           714\n93                 Staten Island Technical High School           711\n365  Queens High School for the Sciences at York Co...           701\n68   High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engi...           683\n280                     Brooklyn Technical High School           682\n333                        Townsend Harris High School           680\n174  High School of American Studies at Lehman College           669\n0    New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...           657\n45                       Eleanor Roosevelt High School           641, 'top_10_schools':                                            school_name  average_SAT\n88                              Stuyvesant High School         2144\n170                       Bronx High School of Science         2041\n93                 Staten Island Technical High School         2041\n174  High School of American Studies at Lehman College         2013\n333                        Townsend Harris High School         1981\n365  Queens High School for the Sciences at York Co...         1947\n5                       Bard High School Early College         1914\n280                     Brooklyn Technical High School         1896\n45                       Eleanor Roosevelt High School         1889\n68   High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engi...         1889, 'largest_SAT_std_dev':            count    mean    std\nborough                        \nManhattan     89  1340.0  230.0}\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"aee8b7b246df8f9039afb4144a1f6fd8d2ca17a180786b69acc140d282b71a49"}},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
