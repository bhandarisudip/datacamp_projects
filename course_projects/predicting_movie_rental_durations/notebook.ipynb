    "A DVD rental company needs your help! They want to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient inventory planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data they provided is in the csv file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n",
    "- `\"rental_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"return_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"amount\"`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"amount_2\"`: The square of `\"amount\"`.\n",
    "- `\"rental_rate\"`: The rate at which the DVD is rented for.\n",
    "- `\"rental_rate_2\"`: The square of `\"rental_rate\"`.\n",
    "- `\"release_year\"`: The year the movie being rented was released.\n",
    "- `\"length\"`: Lenght of the movie being rented, in minuites.\n",
    "- `\"length_2\"`: The square of `\"length\"`.\n",
    "- `\"replacement_cost\"`: The amount it will cost the company to replace the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"special_features\"`: Any special features, for example trailers/deleted scenes that the DVD also has.\n",
    "- `\"NC-17\"`, `\"PG\"`, `\"PG-13\"`, `\"R\"`: These columns are dummy variables of the rating of the movie. It takes the value 1 if the move is rated as the column name and 0 otherwise. For your convinience, the reference dummy has already been dropped."

    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "In this project, you will use regression models to predict the number of days a customer rents DVDs for.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most data science projects, you will need to pre-process the data provided, in this case, a csv file called rental_info.csv. Specifically, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the csv file rental_info.csv using pandas.\n",
    "2. Create a column named \"rental_length_days\" using the columns \"return_date\" and \"rental_date\", and add it to the pandas DataFrame. This column should contain information on how many days a DVD has been rented by a customer.\n",
    "3. Create two columns of dummy variables from \"special_features\", which takes the value of 1 when:\n",
    "    1. The value is \"Deleted Scenes\", storing as a column called \"deleted_scenes\".\n",
    "    1. The value is \"Behind the Scenes\", storing as a column called \"behind_the_scenes\".\n",
    "4. Make a pandas DataFrame called X containing all the appropriate features you can use to run the regression models, avoiding columns that leak data about the target.\n",
    "5. Choose the \"rental_length_days\" as the target column and save it as a pandas Series called y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the preprocessing you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Split the data into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test train and test sets, avoiding any features that leak data about the target variable, and include 20% of the total data in the test set.\n",
    "7. Set random_state to 9 whenever you use a function/method involving randomness, for example, when doing a test-train split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommend a model yielding a mean squared error (MSE) less than 3 on the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Save the model you would recommend as a variable named best_model, and save its MSE on the test set as best_mse."
