    "A DVD rental company needs your help! They want to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient inventory planning.\n",

    "The data they provided is in the csv file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n",
    "- `\"rental_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"return_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n",
    "- `\"amount\"`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n",

    "    1. The value is \"Deleted Scenes\", storing as a column called \"deleted_scenes\".\n",
    "    1. The value is \"Behind the Scenes\", storing as a column called \"behind_the_scenes\".\n",
    "4. Make a pandas DataFrame called X containing all the appropriate features you can use to run the regression models, avoiding columns that leak data about the target.\n",
    "5. Choose the \"rental_length_days\" as the target column and save it as a pandas Series called y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the preprocessing you will need to:\n",
